"""Typed HTTP contracts for admin API endpoints.

Request body models use pydantic v2 ``BaseModel`` with ``extra="ignore"`` while
the API is being migrated. That preserves compatibility with clients that send
extra fields today; individual domains can move to ``extra="forbid"`` once their
frontend contracts are fully typed.

Response models describe the inner payload objects only. Handlers still wrap
them with the existing ``{"ok": true, ...}`` envelope via ``_ok`` and must build
objects through explicit classmethods such as ``from_orm_*``. Avoid pydantic
``from_attributes`` for ORM rows: explicit scalar reads prevent accidental lazy
loads after the SQLAlchemy session scope has closed.

Template for migrated domains:
1. Add request models and parse them with ``parse_body``.
2. Add response models with explicit ``from_orm_*`` constructors.
3. Add parity tests proving the serialized JSON matches the legacy dict helper.
